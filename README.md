# Weather APP
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: This web application provides real-time weather updates for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can input a city name to retrieve the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, displayed with appropriate icons. The app features a clean, responsive design and includes error handling to notify users of invalid city names. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my ability to integrate APIs and create dynamic, user-friendly web interfaces.
